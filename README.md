# Git Collaboration Assignment

Simple Repository to teach how to submit a pull request.

You should do the following:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone the fork onto your computer.
3. Create a new branch for your commit.
4. Add the original as your upstream: git@github.com:BYUHCS490R/git-collaboration.git (everyone should us this as the upstream.)
5. Add a text file named with your name (name.txt).
6. In the text file give a short two sentence introduction. Then add your final project idea.
7. Commit your changes with a commit message. The message should complete the following sentence:
"Applying this commit will ....".  For example "Add intro and project for Bro. Slade".  Notice, you do not include "Applying this commit will".  You will get marked down if you do not have the an appropriate commit message.
8. Push your changes to the origin. The origin is the forked version of the original repo on GitHub. The upstream is the original repo that you forked. You will want to make sure your push your new brach up to the origin.
9. Visit the URL that you get on the command line, after pushing your new brach, to submit a Pull Request.
10. You will have to wait for your pull request to be accepted by me, so it WILL NOT show up in the code area right away, but you should be able to see your pull request waiting, by clicking on pull requests at the top of the repo page on GitHub.
